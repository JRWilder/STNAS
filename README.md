# STNAS
My team of four ECE students and I took on the task of being the first semester of students to work on the Sea Turtle Nestling Alarm System(STNAS) senior design project at NC State University. That being said, our senior design project was developing the proof of concept for the STNAS project. This included a [website](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/stnas/stnas), embedded system, video analytics, PCBs, sensors, cloud integration, wireless communication, alternative energy sources, testing environment, and implementation design.

My two main contributions to this project were developing the Sandbox testing environment which included overseeing its construction, and developing the machine learning model to accurately detect our 3D printed baby sea turtle models in a wide range of lighting conditions.

## Sandbox
As our testing environment needed to simulate a real sea turtle nest and give quick and consistent results, we went with a design that resembled a raised sandbox. The Sandbox is 3' x 3' in area and 10" in height to model the real nest size, raised 2' off the ground so that a 10 gallon bucket can be placed underneath, a tarp to prevent sand escaping through spaces in the wooden boards, and has 16 0.5" holes drilled in the center that allows for variable sand release with a door slid underneath to prevent sand from escaping. The contraption mounted on top of the Sandbox is our basic model of what we called the enclosure. The enclosure contains most of the electronics and is fixed so that the underside is 2' above the sand.
